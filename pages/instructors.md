**Lennart Martens** Lennart Martens is Full Professor of Systems Biology at Ghent University, group leader of the Computational Omics and Systems Biology (CompOmics) group at VIB, and Associate Director of the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, all in Ghent, Belgium. He has been working in proteomics bioinformatics since his Masterâ€™s degree, which focused on the computational interpretation of peptide mass spectra. He then worked as a software developer and framework architect for a software company for a few years, before returning to Ghent University to pursue a Ph.D. focused on proteomics and proteomics informatics. During this time, he worked on the development of high-throughput peptide centric proteomics techniques and on bioinformatics tools to support these new approaches. In 2003 he started the PRIDE proteomics database at the EBI as a Marie Curie fellow of the European Commission. After obtaining his Ph.D., he rejoined the PRIDE group at EBI, which he coordinated for several years before moving back to Ghent University to take up his current position. Prof. Martens has been elected to the Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO) Council in 2016, and to the HUPO Executive Board in 2017. He received the 2014 Prometheus Award for Research Excellence from Ghent University, and the 2015 â€˜Juan Pablo Albarâ€™ Proteomics Pioneer Award from the European Proteomics Association. An author on more than 200 peer-reviewed papers, he has also co- written two popular Wiley textbooks: Computational Methods for Mass Spectrometry Proteomics (ISBN: 978-0-470-51297-5), and Computational and Statistical Methods for Protein Quantification by Mass Spectrometry (ISBN: 978-1-119-96400-1).

**Harald Barsnes** is a group leader at both the Computational Biology Unit at the Department of Informatics and at the Proteomics Unit at the Department of Biomedicine, both at the University of Bergen, Norway. The main focus of his group is the development of user-friendly open-source bioinformatics tools that enable and empower researchers to analyse and share their own data. His research has resulted in numerous publications and a long list of freely available proteomics software, e.g., PeptideShaker, SearchGUI and PRIDE Converter. Barsnes has also been a guest editor in PROTEOMICS and has co-authored a Wiley text book called 'Computational and Statistical Methods for Protein Quantification by Mass Spectrometry'. In 2015 he received the Meltzer Award for Excellent Young Researchers at the University of Bergen, and in 2016 he was awarded a prestigious recruitment fellowship from the Bergen Research Foundation.

**Affiliation**: Department of Biomedicine and Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, NO

**Lieven Clement** is an Associate Professor of Statistical Genomics at Ghent University. He is an expert in developing statistical methods and open source tools for differential omics data analysis. His research efforts resulted in numerous publications on novel methods and tools for, and applied research in omics data analysis. His lab is built around three strategic research pillars each connected to an omics domain: metagenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics and he also has a strong interest in leveraging his expertise to translational research. He also serves as a member of the core team that established a new Master of Science in Bioinformatics at Ghent University, as a board member of the Belgian Proteomics Association, as an expert in genomics projects of the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center (KCE), and as an Associate Editor for the journal Biometrics (2011-2017).

**Affiliation**: Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, Ghent University, Ghent, BE
